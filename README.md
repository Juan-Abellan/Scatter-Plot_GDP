# Scatter-Plot_GDP

## Background & Objectives

Same principle in this exercise, we are going to **recreate** plots from this [article](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/overplotting.html).

To go further and learn more best practices you can read these **4 articles**.

- [Scatter plots](https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/scatter.html),
- [2D density](https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/density2d.html)
- [Simpson Paradox](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/simpson.html),
- [The issue with 3D](https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/3d.html)

### Size and transparency

Increase the **visibility** of your scatter plot with **smaller dots** and a **lower opacity**.
Create a plot with **both** techniques used at the same time.

### Groups

Recreate this plot and use the `hue` option in seaborn scatter plot to **group by category**.

### Faceting and group highlight

Create a **grid** of scatter plots, with each group **highlighted**.

## Data

You will work with the dataset `data/blobs.csv`, located in this exercise folder.

## Tools

For this challenge, we will work with Jupyter Notebook and some Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib and Seaborn. At the end we will play around with  plotly in order to develop an interactive plot.
